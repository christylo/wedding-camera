## ðŸš€ Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start the App
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your app will be running on `http://localhost:3002`

### 2. Test Photo Upload
1. **Go to the main app**: `http://localhost:3002`
2. **Upload a photo**:
   - If camera works: Take a photo with the camera
   - If camera doesn't work: Click "Upload from Gallery" and select a photo
3. **Complete the upload**: Click "Upload This Photo"
4. **See success message**: You should see the beautiful thank you animation

### 3. View Uploaded Photos
1. **Go to admin page**: `http://localhost:3002/admin`
2. **Click "Refresh"** to see your uploaded photos
3. **View details**: See filename, timestamp, and file size
